## Introduction

Arch linux is a lightweight and flexible linux distribution that tries to Keep It Simple. It is a rolling release distribution, which means that you install it once and it will keep updating itself. This is in contrast to distributions like Ubuntu, which have a new release every 6 months.

## Installation

The installation process is a bit more involved than other distributions, but it is well documented on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide).
