                    This is the personal website of 0x4248. It serves as a central location for my projects, research
                    notes, experiments, and long-term technical work.
                    Due to the recent downfall of the internet and the rise of heavy javascript frameworks, I wanted to
                    create a site that lets me share my work in a fast, simple, and accessible way. Therefore this site
                    is simple by design; low bandwith and low resource usage was a major goal.
                    <br>
                    Sadly this site isnt <code>lynx</code>, <code>elinks</code>, or any other text-based browser
                    compatible, but any browser newer than 2010 should have no problem rendering it.
            </div>
            <p>
                This website is heavily inspired by the old-school 2000-2010s web design which always gives me the
                nostalgic vibes of browsing the web in my early childhood. I always strive for simplicity and clear
                organization in my design, and I hope that this site reflects that. I also wanted to make something that

                Take a scroll down to look at some of the things I have been working on recently, and feel free to
                explore the site using the navigation links on the left or top of the page. If you have any questions,
                suggestions, or just want to say hi, you can contact me at <code>0x4248@tuta.io</code>.

                        <p>
                            Due to ongoing political internet censorship and geo-blocking in certain regions, some users
                            may experience difficulty accessing this site.
                            This is common in countries with strict internet regulations <i>(Including recently the
                                UK)</i> and may result in the site being completely inaccessible.
                            If this is the case:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use a VPN or proxy</li>
                            <li>Contact me <code>0x4248@tuta.com</code> to report it with your country, ISP <i>(Dont
                                    disclose more info than you are comfortable with)</i> and any error messages you
                                receive.</li>
                        </ul>
                            Many blocked websites are only small websites, forums, and even personal websites like this.

            <h2>How do I navigate your site?</h2>

            <p>
                Navigation is intentionally simple. This site is in 3 main sections: <a href="/notebook">notebook</a>,
                <a href="/nexus">nexus</a>, and this page your on. I call this page the root pages.
            <p>Each section serves a distinct purpose:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="/notebook">Notebook</a></strong> - This is where I write notes, documentation, and
                    anything i produce in Obsidian. <b>Yes this page has way more JavaScript</b> thats because its
                    done using Quartz which is an amazing project.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="/nexus">Nexus</a></strong> - This is where almost all of my code lives. Its a
                    simple,
                    low-bandwidth git repository browser that I wrote myself.</li>
                <li><strong>Root</strong> - This page. It serves as a landing
                    page and general introduction to the site. I also post news updates and general information about
                    myself here.</li>

            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Lewis (known online as 0x4248)</p>
            <p><strong>Pronouns:</strong> He/They</p>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> 18</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                I am a software developer with a strong interest in operating systems, low-level programming, and cyber
                security.
                I am currently studying Computer Science and spend much of my time working on personal systems-oriented
                projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I live in southern England. Outside of software, I have an interest in radio communications and
                photography.
                I frequently experiment with Linux internals, firmware, and kernel-level components, often targeting
                unconventional or constrained hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also work extensively with Blender for 3D, rendering, and general media production. I use it as my
                primary tool for visual work.
            </p>
